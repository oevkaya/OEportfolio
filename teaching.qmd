    ::: justify-text
    This course will introduce students to practical data representation. It will enable students to understand data visualisation theory and practice, while simultaneously inviting them to challenge and extend these concepts throughout the course. Students will examine a range of different methodologies and practices for representing data in a variety of formats including physical and embodied formats.
    :::

-   [*Insights Through Data (PGT)*](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/24-25/dpt/cxefie11025.htm):

    ::: justify-text
    This course will introduce students to the practical aspects of data science. It will provide a basic background in data science skills and methodologies via direct interaction with data through programming, statistics, and machine learning. The goal of the course is to facilitate a spectrum of insights by analysing different data sets and interpreting the results.
    :::

-   [*Statistics (UG)*](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/24-25/dpt/cxmath08051.htm):

    ::: justify-text
    This course provides an introduction to the basic concepts of Statistics including the examples with R programming language. I have been co-delivering the course focusing on the regression model and Anova.
    :::

-   [*Facets of Mathematics (UG)*](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/23-24/dpt/cx_sb_math.htm):

    ::: justify-text
    This course is based around three key themes from different areas of mathematics, and develops important skills in basic Python, mathematical writing, and document creation using LaTeX. I have been responsible for the third theme about linear models.
    :::
    
-   [*Regression and Simulation Methods (PhD)*](https://smstc.ac.uk/modules/regression-and-simulation-methods):

    ::: justify-text
    This course is based on the key topics which lie at the heart of research in statistical methods and form a basis for more advanced and sophisticated ideas. For two semester, I delivered second half of the course, by covering topics such as Generalised linear models and Simulation and bootstrapping.
